üó∫Ô∏è Map on Solana ‚Äî Tokenized Local Mapping Incentive Protocol
‚ö†Ô∏è Project Status
 This is a work-in-progress prototype developed as part of an experimental collaboration between a Solana smart contract engineer and an ArcGIS developer. While the Solana incentive layer compiles and the ArcGIS workflow is partially implemented, the full integration is ongoing.
üåç Project Description
Map on Solana is a decentralized incentive protocol designed to reward users for contributing geographic data ‚Äî specifically adding or verifying missing local places (caf√©s, shops, landmarks, etc.) ‚Äî to an open community map.
The project reimagines local mapping as a tokenized crowdsourcing mechanism, blending ArcGIS geospatial infrastructure with Solana‚Äôs fast, low-cost blockchain.
Contributors earn tokens for validated additions or corrections, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem of verified, community-driven geodata.
üß± Architecture Overview
Layer
Description
Frontend (ArcGIS Experience Builder)
Users interact with a live map, add missing POIs (points of interest), upload metadata, and view contribution leaderboards.
GIS Backend (ArcGIS Feature Service + Python API)
Validates geospatial submissions, checks duplicates, and normalizes attributes before blockchain submission.
Solana Incentive Layer (Anchor + Rust)
Smart contracts handle staking, proof of contribution, and token distribution. Uses anchor_spl for token minting and a custom geo_incentive program to log mapping actions.
Webhook + Helius Integration
On-chain listener (TypeScript) bridges verified GIS submissions to Solana transactions.
Future State (Planned)
Machine learning model for contribution quality scoring + ArcGIS dashboards for on-chain mapping analytics.
Simplified Flow:
User adds a missing place on ArcGIS map.
The feature service validates geometry and metadata.
Webhook triggers Solana transaction to mint reward tokens.
Data is written both to blockchain (for proof) and ArcGIS layer (for visualization).
‚öôÔ∏è Technical Functionality
Built on Solana v1.18.26, Anchor v0.32.1
Deterministic geo_incentive contract for proof-of-mapping logic
ArcGIS REST API integration for geospatial validation
TypeScript webhook for event streaming via Helius API
Modular programs/ architecture for future scalability
Tested against local validator setup (planned WSL migration)
üí° Product Usefulness & Market Relevance
Addresses the local data gap in developing regions where Google Maps and OSM lack coverage.
Empowers communities, NGOs, and tourism startups to crowdsource accurate POI data while building verifiable proof of contribution.
Bridges Web3 incentives with mainstream GIS ecosystems.
Potential markets:
Tourism operators and local directories
Smart city mapping programs
Environmental and CSR mapping initiatives
üé® Creativity & Innovation
First known hybrid ArcGIS + Solana incentive protocol.
Uses spatial verification logic (distance & attribute validation) prior to token minting.
Introduces ‚ÄúProof of Location Contribution‚Äù (PoLC) ‚Äî a conceptual model rewarding accuracy, not just activity.
Future-ready for AI/ML-based map validation and DAO governance.
üß≠ User Experience (UX/UI)
ArcGIS web app interface 
Real-time map visualization with contribution history.
Simplified ‚Äúconnect wallet ‚Üí map ‚Üí earn‚Äù flow planned post MVP.
Open Source Contribution
Planned publication of an ArcGIS API integration guide to encourage cross-domain GIS + blockchain experiments.
Designed for extensibility ‚Äî allows plug-and-play tokenomics modules (staking, reputation, quadratic rewards).
